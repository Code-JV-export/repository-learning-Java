# Repository learning Java
Repository responsible for keeping all Java code, where I'll be learning something new, and "playing" at the same time.

### I'm adding more learning codes in another repository, these repositories are:
* [Collections](https://github.com/JVagner-codes/collections) - This is a repository where I put codes for the study of Collections
* [Library manager project](https://github.com/JVagner-codes/gerenciador-biblioteca) - In this repository is a library management project, this project was made to practice the OO paradigm
* [Vaccination API](https://github.com/JVagner-codes/vaccinatioapi) - In the repository in question, there is a project related to the creation of an API that could be used in the administration of queues for vaccination
* [Supermarket stock API project](https://github.com/JVagner-codes/supermarket_stock) - In this repository there is a project, where I was practicing the creation of API, as well as the creation of unit tests

### If you want to check the result of the small programs made:
* Open them through an IDE. The most used are: [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/download/#section=windows) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* Or through a terminal, already having the JVM installed
